# LendingClubCaseStudy
> This project focuses on analyzing a loan dataset to identify key variables that can predict loan default. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to discover patterns and insights that could help organization for making better lending decisions.

## Conclusions

- Employment Length and Default Risk:

Borrowers with shorter employment lengths (less than 1 year) are more likely to default on their loans compared to those with longer employment histories. This indicates that employment stability is a critical factor in determining a borrowerâ€™s ability to repay a loan.

- Interest Rates and Default Rates:
  
Higher interest rates are associated with a higher probability of default. Borrowers who are charged higher interest rates are more likely to struggle with repayments, leading to an increased default rate.

- Key Risk Indicators

  The analysis identified critical factors that predict loan defaults, helping Lending Club enhance its loan approval process to minimize defaults while ensuring creditworthy applicants are approved.

- Income and Loan Amounts

 There is a direct correlation between a borrower's income and the loan amount they receive, with higher incomes associated with larger loans. This insight helps in understanding borrower behavior and setting loan limits.
